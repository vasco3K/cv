  <h1>Matthew Wyatt</h1>
  <i>Web Developer</i>
  <br>
  <p>Developer with exposure to and deep involvement
    throughout the full application life cycle in mobile enterprise solutions,
    with skills across iOS, Android, and web services. My expertise lies
    primarily in cross-platform mobile frameworks with other skills in
    back-end (API construction/integration) to complement any mobile
    solution.
    <br>
    I have specifically helped in areas digitizing previously paper-based
    operations of companies looking to optimize their way of business and
    reduce costs.
    <br>
    I have implemented analytical models, catered to highly sensitive
    agricultural data. I have focused on robust, user-friendly experiences in
    environments where applications have been critical to client revenue
    streams and integrate into existing systems with minimal disruption.
